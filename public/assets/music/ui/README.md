# UI Sound Effects

Place user interface sound effects here.

## Recommended UI Sound Files:
- `button-hover.mp3` - Sound for hovering over buttons
- `button-click.mp3` - Sound for clicking buttons
- `menu-open.mp3` - Sound for opening menus
- `notification.mp3` - Sound for notifications
- `error.mp3` - Sound for errors or warnings

## Tips:
- Keep UI sounds very short (< 0.5 seconds)
- Use subtle sounds that won't annoy users
- Consider adding volume controls in the app
- Test sounds at different volumes
